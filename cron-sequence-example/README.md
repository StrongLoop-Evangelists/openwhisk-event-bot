# Make An Event-Driven Bot with OpenWhisk, Cron-Trigger Version

What does this example do? This example: 

* creates a OpenWhisk action (`pigify`) that receives text, turns it into Pig Latin, and tweets it;
* creates an OpenWhisk action (`findTweets`) that polls the Twitter API looking for mentions of your bot's name, and then calling the `pigify` action;
* creates a trigger that fires once an hour, five minutes after the hour; 
* creates a rule that connects the 'once-an-hour' trigger with the `findTweets` action.


## General Setup

### 1. Clone this repo

Prerequisites: I assume you have node and npm installed. Need help installing either? [Here's a link for you.](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/85484771375/how-to-install-npm)

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Open in your favorite editor.

### 2. Get Credentials and Add Configuration

##### Twitter
* It's best to create a new Twitter account for your bot, instead of tweeting Pig Latin from your personal Twitter account. You can sign up for a Twitter account [here](https://twitter.com).
* a Twitter application (not the same as a Twitter account; apply for one at [apps.twitter.com](apps.twitter.com))
* a Consumer Key, a Consumer Secret, an Access Token, and your Access Token Secret

_NOTE_: when you sign up for a Twitter app, it will ask for a website and a callback URL. You can enter your bot's Twitter URL for the website (e.g., https://www.twitter.com/YOURBOTNAME) and you can leave the callback URL blank.

Also _NOTE_: You may be asked to connect a phone number to your Twitter app account. If you have your phone connected to a different Twitter account, just disconnect it from that account and connect it to the bot account to create your keys. Once your keys are set, you can delete and reattach the number to your primary account.

Put your key, secret, token, and access token secret in the `temp-config.js` file, and rename it to `config.js`. Then delete `temp-config.js`.

## Create your `pigify` OpenWhisk Action

Because we want to include the npm module `pig-latin` and our config file, we're going to create our OpenWhisk action by uploading a zip file.

 1. Make sure you're in the `pigify-action` directory.
 2. Make sure your `config.js` file is created and includes your keys.
 3. Run `npm install`
 4. Zip the files in this directory: `zip -r -X "pigify.zip" *` 
 5. Create your OpenWhisk action: `wsk action create pigify --kind nodejs:6 pigify.zip`
 6. Check to see if your action has been created: `wsk action list`.
 
## Create your `findTweets` OpenWhisk Action

Because we want to include the `moment` library and our config file, we're going to create our OpenWhisk action by uploading a zip file.

 1. Make sure you're in the `pigify-action` directory.
 2. Make sure your `config.js` file is created and includes your keys.
 3. Run `npm install`
 4. Zip the files in this directory: `zip -r -X "pigify.zip" *` 
 5. Create your OpenWhisk action: `wsk action create pigify --kind nodejs:6 pigify.zip`
 6. Check to see if your action has been created: `wsk action list`.
 
## Create your OpenWhisk Trigger
 
 We want our bot to tweet once an hour (don't have your bot tweet more than once an hour; that's kind of rude), so we're going to create an OpenWhisk trigger that runs our function. 
 
You can set an alarm trigger with `cron` (let's call it `sendTweet`) to make this happen, like so: 

`wsk trigger create sendTweet --feed /whisk.system/alarms/alarm --param cron "5 * * * 0-6"`

Cron syntax is tricky! If you don't want to remember it, you can use this handy [crontab generator](http://crontab-generator.org/).
 
 
## Create your OpenWhisk Rule

Once you have an action and a trigger, you can put them together with a rule, like so: 

`wsk rule create tweetRule sendTweet myTwitterBot`

The format here is 
`wsk rule create NameOfRule NameOfTrigger NameOfAction`

## Test it out!

You don't have to wait for your alarm to go offâ€”you can fire your trigger like so: 

`wsk trigger fire sendTweet`

Remember: if nobody has mentioned your new bot on Twitter your bot will not tweet. :)
